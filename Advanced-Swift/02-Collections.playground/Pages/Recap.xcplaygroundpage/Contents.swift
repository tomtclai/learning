## Recap

In this chapter, we saw a number of different collections: arrays, dictionaries,
sets, index sets, and ranges. We also looked at a number of methods that each of
these collections have, and in the next chapter, we'll see that most of those
methods are defined on the `Sequence` protocol. We saw how Swift's built-in
collections allow you to control mutability through `let` and `var`, and we also
saw how to make sense of all the different `Range` types.
