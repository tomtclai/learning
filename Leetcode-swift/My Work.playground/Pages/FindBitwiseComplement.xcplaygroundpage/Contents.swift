/*:
 Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

 Note:
 1. The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 2. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

 ```
 Input: 5
 Output: 2
 ```
 Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

 ```
 Input: 1
 Output: 0
 ```
 Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
