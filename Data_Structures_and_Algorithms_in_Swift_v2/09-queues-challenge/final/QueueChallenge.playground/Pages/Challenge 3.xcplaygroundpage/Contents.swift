 ## Challenge 3
 
 Imagine that you are playing a game of Monopoly with your friends. The problem
 is that everyone always forget whose turn it is! Create a Monopoly organizer
 that always tells you whose turn it is. Below is a protocol that you can
 conform to:
 */

public protocol BoardGameManager {
    
  associatedtype Player
  mutating func nextPlayer() -> Player?
}

extension QueueArray: BoardGameManager {
    
  public typealias Player = T
  
  public mutating func nextPlayer() -> T? {
    guard let person = dequeue() else {
      return nil
    }
    enqueue(person)
    return person
  }
}

var queue = QueueArray<String>()
queue.enqueue("Vincent")
queue.enqueue("Remel")
queue.enqueue("Lukiih")
queue.enqueue("Allison")
print(queue)

print("===== boardgame =======")
queue.nextPlayer()
print(queue)
queue.nextPlayer()
print(queue)
queue.nextPlayer()
print(queue)
queue.nextPlayer()
print(queue)
