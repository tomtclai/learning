 # Binary Tree Challenges
 
 ## Challenge 1
 Given a binary tree, find the height of the tree. The height of the binary tree
 is determined by the distance between the root and the furthest leaf. The
 height of a binary tree with a single node is zero, since the single node is
 both the root and the furthest leaf.

  let zero = BinaryNode(value: 0)
  let one = BinaryNode(value: 1)
  let five = BinaryNode(value: 5)
  let seven = BinaryNode(value: 7)
  let eight = BinaryNode(value: 8)
  let nine = BinaryNode(value: 9)
  
  seven.leftChild = one
  one.leftChild = zero
  one.rightChild = five
