 For each of the following two examples, which traversal (depth-first or
 breadth-first) is better for discovering if a path exists between the
 two nodes? Explain why.

 Path from **A** to **F**.
 */
// Use depth-first, because the path you are looking for is deeper in the graph.
/*:
 Path from **A** to **G**.
