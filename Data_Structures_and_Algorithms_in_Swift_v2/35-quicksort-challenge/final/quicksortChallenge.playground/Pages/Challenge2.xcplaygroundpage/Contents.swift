 ## Challenge 2
 
 Explain when and why you would use merge sort over quicksort.
 */

/*

 - Merge sort is preferable over quick sort when you need stability. Merge sort
   is a stable sort and guarantees _O_(_n_ log _n_). This is not the case with
   quick sort, which isn’t stable and can perform as bad as _O_(_n²_).
 
 - Merge sort works better for larger data structures or data structures where
   elements are scattered throughout memory. Quick sort works best when elements
   are stored in a contiguous block.
