# Introduction

Why write this book? There's plenty of documentation on Swift readily available
from Apple, and there are many more books on the way. Why does the world need
yet another book on yet another programming language?

This book tries to teach you to think *functionally*. We believe that Swift has
the right language features to teach you how to write *functional programs*. But
what makes a program functional? And why bother learning about this in the first
place?

It's hard to give a precise definition of functional programming â€” in the same
way, it's hard to give a precise definition of object-oriented programming, or
any other programming paradigm for that matter. Instead, we'll try to focus on
some of the *qualities* that we believe well-designed functional programs in
Swift should exhibit:

  - **Modularity:** Rather than thinking of a program as a sequence of
    assignments and method calls, functional programmers emphasize that each
    program can be repeatedly broken into smaller and smaller pieces, and all
    these pieces can be assembled using function application to define a
    complete program. Of course, this decomposition of a large program into
    smaller pieces only works if we can avoid sharing state between the
    individual components. This brings us to our next point.

  - **A Careful Treatment of Mutable State:** Functional programming is
    sometimes (half-jokingly) referred to as 'value-oriented programming.'
    Object-oriented programming focuses on the design of classes and objects,
    each with their own encapsulated state. Functional programming, on the other
    hand, emphasizes the importance of programming with values, free of mutable
    state or other side effects. By avoiding mutable state, functional programs
    can be more easily combined than their imperative or object-oriented
    counterparts.

  - **Types:** Finally, a well-designed functional program makes careful use of
    *types*. More than anything else, a careful choice of the types of your data
    and functions will help structure your code. Swift has a powerful type
    system that, when used effectively, can make your code both safer and more
    robust.

We feel these are the key insights that Swift programmers may learn from the
functional programming community. Throughout this book, we'll illustrate each of
these points with many examples and case studies.

In our experience, learning to think functionally isn't easy. It challenges the
way we've been trained to decompose problems. For programmers who are used to
writing `for` loops, recursion can be confusing; the lack of assignment
statements and global state is crippling; and closures, generics, higher-order
functions, and monads are just plain weird.

Throughout this book, we'll assume that you have previous programming experience
in Objective-C (or some other object-oriented language). We won't cover Swift
basics or teach you to set up your first Xcode project, but we will try to refer
to existing Apple documentation when appropriate. You should be comfortable
reading Swift programs and familiar with common programming concepts, such as
classes, methods, and variables. If you've only just started to learn to
program, this may not be the right book for you.

In this book, we want to demystify functional programming and dispel some of the
prejudices people may have against it. You don't need to have a PhD in
mathematics to use these ideas to improve your code\! Functional programming
isn't the *only* way to program in Swift. Instead, we believe that learning
about functional programming adds an important new tool to your toolbox, which
will make you a better developer in any language.

### Updates to the Book

As Swift evolves, we'll continue to make updates and enhancements to this book.
