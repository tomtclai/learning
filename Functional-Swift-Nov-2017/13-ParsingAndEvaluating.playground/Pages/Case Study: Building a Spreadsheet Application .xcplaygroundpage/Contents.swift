# Case Study: Building a Spreadsheet Application 

In this chapter, we'll expand on the code for parsing arithmetic expressions
from the last chapter and build a simple spreadsheet application on top of it.
We'll divide the work into three steps: first we have to write the parser for
the expressions we want to support; then we have to write an evaluator for these
expressions; and lastly we have to integrate this code into a simple user
interface.
