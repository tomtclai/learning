        Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with \
        Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the \
        farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build \
        it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four \
        walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room \
        contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the \
        dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle \
        Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a \
        little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and \
        no cellar--except a small hole dug in the ground, called a \
        cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those \
        great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in \
        its path. It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the \
        floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.

        When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could \
        see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a \
        tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that \
        reached to the edge of the sky in all directions. The sun had \
        baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks \
        running through it. Even the grass was not green, for the sun \
        had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the \
        same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been \
        painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed \
        it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything \
        else.
