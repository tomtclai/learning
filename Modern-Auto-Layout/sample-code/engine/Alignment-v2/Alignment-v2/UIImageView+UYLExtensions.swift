     A convenience initializer to create a UIImageView with an image that has the specified edge insets. The UIImage is created from the named file with the specified edge insets.

     - Note: The image view is created with the `translatedAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints` flag set to false ready for use with a constraints based layout.

     - Parameter named: A String which should match the name of a valid image file in the application bundle or asset
     catalog.
     - Parameter top: The inset at the top of an object.
     - Parameter left: The inset on the left of an object.
     - Parameter bottom: The inset on the bottom of an object.
     - Parameter right: The inset on the right of an object.

     - Returns: The newly created UIImageView.
